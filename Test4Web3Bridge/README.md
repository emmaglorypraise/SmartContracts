# Problem statement
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Hardhat tools with MAINNET fORKING:

i)  Write a script that interract with at least two functions on uniswap router contract excluding the one used in class.

SOLUTION: found in uniswap.ts, IUniswap.sol, IERC20.sol

ii) write a smart contract that does anything you want and deploy it to testnet and also use the script to call a write function in your smart contract.
Copy and paste the transaction hash inside your script file and push your project to gihub.

SOLUTION: found in deploy.ts, Lottery.sol, ILottery.sol, screenshot found in sccreenshot folder


The two questions must be in the same hardhat file.

Thank you!

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
